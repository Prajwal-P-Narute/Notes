            <h2>What is SDLC?</h2>
            <p>Software development life cycle consists of set of particular stages which start from information gathering to the maintenance of product.</p>
            
            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4>Definition</h4>
                <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Stages in SDLC</h2>
            
            <div class="stages-grid">
                <div class="stage-item">
                    <h4><span class="stage-number">1</span>Information Gathering</h4>
                    <p>BA is responsible for gathering the information from customers. Information gathering is nothing but collecting requirement from customers. Information gathering involves business requirements specification (BRS). BRS is bridge between client to developers & testers. BRS is a document that contains all (overall) requirements related to the application. BA is responsible for preparing BRS documents.</p>

                    <p>Here also BA is responsible person. In this phase BA will prepare software requirement specification (SRS). SRS is detail level documents. SRS document is also known as functional requirement specification.</p>

                    <p><strong>Low Level Design:</strong> Contains the working of sub modules. Low level design is created by Front end developer. Ex. If any sign-up page is main module, then name, password, mobile no etc. are the sub functionality of main module.</p>

                <p><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> Waterfall model is step by step implementation of SDLC. In waterfall model requirements are fixed. If first stage is complete and process goes to next phase, then we cannot revert back to the first phase. Generally, waterfall model is used in small scale company or small application. The general time duration of waterfall model is 3 months. In waterfall model, when tester finds any bug then they do not send that back to the developer, instead they log the bug, make report & those bugs get fixed in next version of software.</p>
                
                <p><strong>V-Model:</strong> V stands for verification and validation. V model has working in which verification and validation phases run parallel. In V model development stages are mapped with testing stages. In V model, if one stage gets completed and 2nd is running but changes occurred in 1st phase then we can revert back to 1st phase but customer have to pay some amount to company. The duration of V model is 3 months. It is used for large application. Generally, this method is not used nowadays.</p>
